Fabliaux
=====================


**HTR data sets from medieval manuscripts (13th-14th c.) collecting "fabliaux" in Old French**


*project-website: https://projet.biblissima.fr/fr/appels-projets/projets-retenus/fabliaux*

The project aims at creating a digital corpus of medieval French fabliaux, in XML-TEI format, perennial and searchable, hosted on the Base de Français Médiéval in order to promote cross-searching between texts.

The database will offer a facsimile of the manuscript, the diplomatic edition and the scientific edition of each fabliau according to the ecdotal principles in force, as well as notes specifying the sources, the versions in other languages and the legacies left to later centuries. Links to Jonas, Arlima and the general catalog of the BnF will lead to the bibliography devoted to them.

The first stage of the work will consist in proposing a reference text for each fabliau in order to bring back to the forefront this literature sometimes considered as marginal and yet preserved in many manuscripts.

Subsequently, it will make available the text of the largest possible number of witnesses by relying on the resources of the HTR in order to carry out a work of reconstitution family by family and to transcribe in their entirety the large collections of fabliaux.
